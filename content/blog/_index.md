The garbage and negative energy you carry coming out of a toxic relationship or divorce can cause paralyzing side effects:

* Mood swings
* Mental fog
* Forgetfulness
* Doubt & disappointment in self
* Distrust
* Emotional eating or not eating
* Weight gain
* Severe fatigue and lethargy
* Overprescribed/unnecessary medications
* More medications to treat the side effects of the meds leading, in some cases, to misdiagnosis
* Feelings of Isolation
* Depression
* Anxiety
* Sleep deprivation
* Digestive issues

Emotional trauma can destroy the proper function of your immune, adrenal, nervous, and endocrine systems that lead to auto-immune disorders including severe allergies, digestive issues, pain throughout your body or in localized areas, skin problems, cognitive challenges, etc. . . . . Our spiritual relationships can also become damaged and hindered--if our broken heart wasn’t enough.

The effects from these traumas make us feel the overwhelm of what seems like an endless journey ahead surrounded by steep obstacles and hills to climb of joyless days and nightmarish nights.  But, by moving forward with motivating supports, you eventually see the beauty within the journey.  You find yourself again with a renewed spirit, vitality, and an immense joy with boundless energy and clarity to do more than just survive.

  A health coach who has survived through it all, but now thrives in body and spirit is the motivating support, guide, and cheerleader you need to get back on your feet and thrive in vitality.  A health coach can guide you on your journey toward better health and wellness by encouraging those healthy daily habits and lifestyle choices you wish to make to flex your resilience and grow stronger each day in mind, body, and spirit.  You deserve to feel the genuine joy you were always purposed to embody.

Are you ready to take action to become that mother, sister, family member, and friend you desire to be, unleashing the QUEEN from within you, but need that extra support to encourage you in those crucial moments to move forward. Therefore, if you’re tired of just surviving each day on automatic and are ready to take action toward your healing to truly enjoy the life you were meant to live in a safe space with someone who has lived it and is now thriving, contact Coach Amy Marie to schedule a 15-minute phone session for more information.  Email:  thrive.in.vitality@gmail.com
