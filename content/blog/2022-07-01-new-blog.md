  **   As a certified health coach, I empower clients as the expert of their own bodies, minds, and spirits to navigate health concerns, discover what may be blocking long term benefits, and guide clients to create healthy habits that lead to long-term results in balancing body chemistry, losing or gaining weight, and maintaining overall health and wellness. I am passionate about collaborating with the client and other experts to guide the client in achieving optimal health.Â  Ultimately, my goal is to assist clients holistically in learning how to balance body chemistry through nutrition and lifestyle choices, and to become autonomous resource agents in their own health and wellness journey.**
