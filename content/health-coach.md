     As  a graduate of the largest health coaching school in the world, IIN (International Institute of Nutrition), located in New York, I earned a Health Coaching Certificate and am trained to empower individuals to make informed choices and lifestyle changes that will improve their health and wellness in the various aspects of life including nutrition and fitness habits despite a busy lifestyle.  I specialize in educating each individual to integrate positive habits into their life long- term and discover what has blocked them from progressing with their health and wellness goals which means getting to the root of the problems and not covering over symptoms of those issues.  In addition, I guide individuals in becoming their own best advocate in their health and wellness journey through education.  
     In addition to enjoying time with my two teenage daughters attending local art displays, music concerts in the Lehigh Valley, and driving them to their sports and work activities, I enjoy walks with my rescued 10 year old Chihuahua, attending the gym with my youngest daughter, dancing through the neighbor to spice up my daily walks, and spending time with family and friends at the beach and in the mountains.  I love to read in my free time about education, health, and fitness, as well as, write in my journal and listen to music across many genres.  I actively make myself available to community members looking for spiritual balance in their lives by engaging in a worldwide education work as well. 
     Furthermore, I hold a Bachelor of Science degree from Pennsylvania State University in Secondary Education in the areas of English Communications  as well as certifications in elementary and secondary education and presently teach Middle School English Language Arts.  Moreover, I have over 20 years experience working as an educator and mental and behavioral health worker with a wide range of age groups and families.   Furthermore, my passion for health, fitness, and wellness started as a child.  Therefore, my journey and education comes from so much more than education, work experience, and training with professionals in the field.  
     My childhood passion of health and fitness, a strong spiritual upbringing, overcoming struggles with ADHD and situational depression over the years, my childrenâ€™s struggle with illness and behaviors impeding their education due to digestive issues, and enduring emotional and physical trauma from domestic violence all played a role in igniting the desire to establish Thrive in Vitality to provide hope and progress for others who have experienced things in their lives that have robbed them of their physical energy and vitality of life.  Through empowerment and compassion, Amy Marie endeavors to assist others to regain that vitality and take it to another level and heal from the past to a brighter, more energized present and future through the holistic approach to health and wellness.
