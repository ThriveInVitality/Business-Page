## Who Benefits? Who does not benefit
Who benefits from a health coach and how?


- Are you tired of being tired?  

- Perhaps you constantly feel symptomatic and run down with only brief periods of reprieve between bouts of - sickness.  

- Do your doctors send you home with a good bill of health regardless of feeling unwell?

- Are you exhausted trying to find the right diet and exercise program that works for you, or that you are able to remain motivated to follow?  

- Maybe you have lost a good amount of weight, and you are so close to reaching your ultimate goal, but have hit a plateau or just want to maintain your weight, strength, and health.

- Perhaps, you feel up to this point you haven’t had the time, energy, discipline, or motivation to stick to a plan that may have worked, but life just keeps getting in the way.   However, now you are ready to transform and make change, but, you just don’t know where to begin or how to sustain a healthier lifestyle.

- If you understand that natural approaches to attaining health takes time and you are willing to put the work into learning new strategies and  information about your individual health and wellness needs, you are a prime candidate for benefiting from a health coaching program. 

- Some of us have so much going on in our lives trying to survive and care for others, that we can’t even begin to focus on where to start or how to remain on track toward our Health & Wellness goals, but you desire change.

In all of these cases, a health coach can optimize your time, energy, and provide you with resources until you become your own best advocate and cheerleader in this maze of health and wellness.  A health coach helps you discover the root of your symptoms instead of just masking and covering over them temporarily.   A health coach does this by asking critical questions each time you meet to draw out the expert in you and help you devise a holistic individualized plan that you CAN implement to optimize your health and wellness.  Moreover, a health coach continues to challenge you to step outside your comfort zone to implement strategies along your journey to keep you on the road to long-term wellness.  A health coach provides the education, resources, and support you need to remain motivated and holds you accountable to keep moving forward toward your goals so you can thrive in the vitality of life.

Therefore, if you are ready for change and are willing to take this journey, now is the time to book your initial consultation today with Certified Health Coach Amy Marie to start your progress toward permanent solutions and satisfying long-term transformations so you can thrive in vitality in all aspects of your life.

### Who does NOT benefit from a health coach and why?

Do you feel that you are living a balanced healthy lifestyle in career, relationships, spirituality, nutrition, exercise, etc . . .  ?
Perhaps, you’ve found the right nutrition regimen and exercise program that is working for you.
You may not be happy with how you feel, and you may not be satisfied with your weight and size, but you are NOT ready to make changes.
Are you severely ill and under the care of a doctor and on a number of medications?
Maybe you are severely ill and have not yet consulted with your doctor for a diagnosis?
You do not like learning new things or applying the things that you learn.
You just don’t have the time to implement habits into your lifestyle at the moment or have room in your schedule to meet an hour every other week with your health coach due to your present circumstances.

Unfortunately, if you are unable to make the time to attend your health coaching sessions on a regular basis, the program will be ineffective and perhaps altogether hindered.  Moreover, if you are not motivated to make changes in your life to create balance or to reach your health and wellness goals, no matter what a health coach does for you, it will not benefit.  If you are not open-minded to learn new things, health coaching will not help since a major part of the program is education.  If you are on a cocktail of medications and are severely ill with numerous diagnoses, health coaching is not for you.
