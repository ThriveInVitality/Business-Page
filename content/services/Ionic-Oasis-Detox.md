title: IONIC OASIS DETOX FOOT BATHS
description: "The Ionic Oasis Detox Foot Bath process stimulates cellular
  functions necessary to transport nutrients across cellular membranes and aid
  in the elimination of toxins.  Although this is a naturally-occurring process,
  our diet, stress levels, exposure to environmental toxins, and lack of
  exercise impedes the easy elimination of cellular debris every day and
  compromises our health.  Regular Ionic Footbaths can help your body function
  at it’s optimal level. "
